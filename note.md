ðŸš€ Day 7 of #Next js

Today I connected my Next.js project to MongoDB using Mongoose ðŸ™Œ

ðŸ”§ What I did:
âœ… Setup `.env.local` with DB URI  
âœ… Created a reusable DB connection file  
âœ… Built a test API route using Next.js App Router  
âœ… Hit the route and confirmed DB is working ðŸŽ¯

ðŸ“Œ Learned how to use `NextResponse`, environment variables, and structure API routes in `src/app/api`.

Excited to move forward with creating models and data handling from tomorrow! ðŸ’»
