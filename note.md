# ðŸ“Œ Day 7 â€“ Connecting MongoDB to Next.js using Mongoose

## ðŸ”¹ Task Overview:

Today, I successfully connected my Next.js project to MongoDB using Mongoose. This setup marks the beginning of backend integration in my project.

---

## âœ… What I Did:

- Configured the `.env.local` file with the MongoDB URI.
- Created a reusable MongoDB connection file using Mongoose.
- Built a test API route inside the `app/api` directory using the new App Router.
- Hit the API route using a browser or API client to confirm the database connection is working properly.

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned:

- How to manage environment variables securely in Next.js using `.env.local`.
- How to use `NextResponse` to send JSON responses in API routes.
- How to structure API routes inside `src/app/api/` in a clean and modular way.
- The basic flow of backend setup in a full-stack Next.js project.

# ðŸ“Œ Day 8 â€“ Backend Setup with Mongoose in Next.js

## ðŸ”¹ Task Overview:

Today, I worked on improving the MongoDB connection logic using `mongoose.connection.readyState` and added Mongoose models for the application.

---

## âœ… What I Did:

### 1. Database Connection Optimization

- Checked if the MongoDB connection is already active using `mongoose.connection.readyState === 1`.
- If connected, return immediately and avoid reconnecting.
- If not connected, then proceed to connect.
- This makes the backend more efficient and prevents multiple reconnections during development.

---

### 2. Created Mongoose Models

- Added a `User` model to define user structure (like username, email, googleId, etc.).
- Added a `Course` model to store course details (title, description, and createdAt).
- Used proper export logic to handle Next.js hot reloading and avoid duplicate model definitions.

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned:

- Importance of checking connection state before reconnecting to MongoDB.
- How to organize and structure Mongoose models in a Next.js project.
- Preventing Mongoose overwrite errors using conditional exports.

# ðŸ“š Revision Notes: Google Authentication + Mongoose Models Setup in Next.js

## âœ… Authentication Setup Using NextAuth (Google OAuth)

- **Library Used**: `NextAuth.js`
- **Purpose**: Authenticate users via Google login.
- **Route File**: `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- **Configured Providers**: Google
  - Requires `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- **Session Handling**: JWT-based session strategy

### ðŸ”¸ Important NextAuth Settings

```ts
session: {
  strategy: "jwt"
},
secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
